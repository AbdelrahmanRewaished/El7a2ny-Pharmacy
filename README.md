## Motivation 💡

Bringing _convenience_, _speed_, and _ease of use_ to the forefront of healthcare is our primary objective.

We aim to simplify the way patients order medications and have it delivered to their doorstep through an extremely intuitive and fast process, acknowledging the importance of being precise in situations of urgency where medication is needed as fast as possible with no time to try to figure out how to use the system, all while not compromising on the quality of the system in any regard. We also provide the necessary tools for Pharmacists and Admins to operate the system effectively and efficiently with these same principles in mind.

We eliminate any and all visual clutter that most Pharmacy systems right now suffer from, and simplify the processes as much as possible, making it possible to learn and use the system instantly.

## Build Status 🏗️

- The project is currently in development.
- A CI/CD pipeline needs to be implemented.
- Testing needs to be implemented for the backend using Jest.
- Authorization middleware needs to be added to the API endpoints.

## Code Style 💻

The code style is enforced using `prettier`.
